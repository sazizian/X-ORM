# Y-MAP: A Multi-Encoder Neural Framework for Optimizing Object-Relational Schema Design

## Overview

**Y-MAP** is a hybrid neural-symbolic framework designed to optimize object-relational mapping (ORM) schema designs without requiring runtime benchmarking. The system combines **formal schema synthesis**, **multi-encoder deep learning**, and **Pareto-based tradeoff analysis** to deliver performance-aware relational database designs tailored to specific application contexts.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Encoder Architecture**: Fuses representations from **GraphCodeBERT**, **CodeT5**, and **LLaMA** to capture schema design's structural, syntactic, and semantic characteristics.
- **Performance Prediction Without Benchmarking**: Accurately estimates **insert latency**, **query latency**, and **memory usage** using a trained regression model.
- **Gaussian-Perturbed Local Search**: Efficiently explores large schema design spaces by perturbing embedding neighborhoods.
- **Symbolic Schema Synthesis**: Utilizes **Alloy-based bounded synthesis** to enumerate valid ORM schemas for training.
- **Pareto-Optimal Selection**: Supports multi-objective reasoning by identifying tradeoff-balanced schema designs.

---

## Applications

Y-MAP can be integrated into a wide range of software engineering scenarios, including:

- **Automated ORM Design**: Replacing default mappings generated by tools like Hibernate or Django ORM.
- **Software Refactoring**: Optimizing existing schemas for better performance or scalability.
- **Interactive Developer Tools**: Embedding schema recommendations into IDEs or DevOps pipelines.
- **Database Education & Research**: Studying the effects of design choices on performance across multiple axes.
